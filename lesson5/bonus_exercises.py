# BONUS EXERCISES
# We learned about the range function earlier.
# There are more ways to use the range function.
#
# Range starts at 0 by default, but we can specify a starting point.
# range(2, n) outputs a list of numbers from 2 to n - 1
#   Example: range(2, 5) --> 2, 3, 4
#
# Range increments by 1 by default
# range(2, n, 2) outputs a list of numbers from 2 to n - 1, incrementing by 2.
#   Example: range(2, 10, 2) --> 2, 4, 6, 8

# Exercise 10:
#   Using for loops, print the ASCII image:
#       ****
#       ***
#       **
#       *
#       ****
#       ***
#       **
#       *

# Exercise 11:
#   Using two for loops, print the multiplication table (tabuada) from 0 to 10

# Exercise 12:
#   1) Make a new variable n equal to 10
#   2) Using a for loop, calculate n factorial
#
#   Note: factorial is n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1

# Exercise 13:
#   1) Make a new variable n equal to 12
#   2) Using a for loop, calculate the nth Fibonacci number
#
#   Note: The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and 1
#         The next number is found by adding the two previous numbers
#         So, the third Fibonacci number is 0 + 1, or 1.
#         The first few are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.
