# Exercise 8:
#   Use a for loop with a break to print all the characters in a
#   string until there are two consecutive characters.
#
#   For example, if the string is

sentence = "Programming is fun!"

#   The output should be "Program".  Remember that you can use
#   a variable to keep track of the previous letter, and you
#   can use == to compare two letters.

# Exercise 9:
#   Use a loop with the continue keyword to print all numbers from
#   0 through 19, with the exception of all multiples of 5.
