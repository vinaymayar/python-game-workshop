# Exercise 1:
print(20 + 4)
print(20 - 4)
print(20 * 4)
print(20 / 4)

# Exercise 2:
print(10 + 4)
print(10 - 4)
print(10 * 4)
print(10 / 4)

# Exercise 3:
print(10 + 4.0)
print(10 - 4.0)
print(10 * 4.0)
print(10 / 4.0)
# 4.0 is a floating point number, whereas 4 is an integer
# Arithmetic with floating point numbers produces floating point results

# Exercise 4:
#   When computing by hand, the answer is 30
#   The answer in Python is 25
#   We are using integers, so 5 / 2 = 2, rather than 2.5
#   Thus, we are computing 8 + (2 * 10) - 3

# Exercise 5:
#   The answer in Python is 25.0
#   5 and 2 are still integers, so 5 / 2 is still equal to 2
#   We then multiply by 10.0, which produces a floating point result
#   Thus, the answer is a floating point number

# Exercise 6:
#   The answer in Python is 30.0
#   2.0 is now a floating point number, so we can perform floating point division
#   5 / 2.0 = 2.5
#   Thus, we get the expected result from our hand calculations!

# Exercise 7:
#   If n % 2 == 0, then the number is even
#   If n % 2 == 1, then the number is odd

# Exercise 8:
#   3849381 % 7 = 4
#   Remainder is 4, so 3849381 is not a multiple of 7

# Exercise 9:
print(12345 % 10)

# Exercise 10:
print(10**2)

# Exercise 11:
print(10.5**2)

# Exercise 12:
print(10**2.5)

# For exercises 13 - 24, there are many possible answers
# Exercise 13:
print(10 * 2 + 70 / 2 - 5)

# Exercise 14:
print((5 + 15) * (57 - 7))

# Exercise 15:
print(10.0 + 4 * 5 * 2)

# Exercise 16:
print((80 + 20.0) * (1 + 9.0))

# Exercise 17:
print((168 - 67) / 2.0)

# Exercise 18:
print(4002 / 2 / 2.0)

# Exercise 19:
print((49 % 5 + 1) * 10)

# Exercise 20:
print((30 % 8 + 4) * (7 % 5 + 2 * 2 * 2))

# Exercise 21:
print(2**6 - 14.0)

# Exercise 22:
print(10**3.0)

# Exercise 23:
print(12345 / 10 % 10)
