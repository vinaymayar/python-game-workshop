# Exercise 3:
#
# In this exercise we will create a program that identifies whether someone can
# enter a super secret club.
# Below are the people that are allowed in the club.
# If your name is Bill Gates, Steve Jobs or Jesus, you should be allowed in the
# club.
# If your name is not one of the above, but your name is Maria and you are less
# than 30 years old, then you should be allowed in the club.
# If you don't fulfill the conditions above, but you are older than 100 years
# ol,d you should also be allowed.
# If none of the conditions are met, you shouldn't be allowed in the club.

print("What's your name?")
name = raw_input() # The raw_input() function allows you to get user input,
                   # don't worry about functions now.
print("What's your age?")
age = input()

if name == 'Bill Gates' or ...
# print something saying that the guest was allowed in the club
# don't forget indentation.
elif name == 'Maria' ...

elif ...

else ...
# print something saying that the guest was not allowed in the club
#
# Test out your program and see if it works as it is supposed to.
