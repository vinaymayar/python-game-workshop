# Fill in the missing code

year_i_was_born =
this_year =
my_age = this_year - year_i_was_born
# We defined my_age in terms of the variables this_year and year_i_was_born

# What happens to my_age if I reassign this_year or year_i_was_born?
# Reassign one of the variables and see what happens!
# Why does that happen?
