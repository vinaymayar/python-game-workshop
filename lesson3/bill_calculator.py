# Exercise 4: Bill calculator.

# The total cost of your meal was 44.85 reais. However, there's a tax of 6.75%
# added to that. Moreover, there's still a 10% service charge.

# Use your newly acquired coding skills to create a calculator for your meal.


your_name = ""

meal_price = 44.85
tax =
service =
meal_final =

print ({}"'s calculator says the total price is: {} reais".format(your_name, meal_final))

# Try writing the tax value using the "/" operator.


# Bonus: How could you write your bill calculator using fewer variables?
# What are the advantages and the disadvantages of that?

# Bonus 2: How could you write the calculator in 1 line of code (not counting
# the print statement)?

# Bonus 3: Instead of always having the same value for the meal, ask the user
# how much the meal cost.
# You can do this by replacing "44.85" with "input()"
# Something like:
# meal_price = input()
# The above line will make your program wait for the user to type something and
# press 'enter'
# Don't forget to add a print statement before asking for use input!
