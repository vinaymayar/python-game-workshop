# Exercise 5: Calculate areas.

# Now, do it all on your own. What's the area of a circle?

# Write a program that calculates and prints the value of the area of a circle.

# Remember that the formula for the circle's area is
#   area = pi * (radius)^2


# Bonus: Experiment and try calculating the area of other shapes.

# Bonus 2: Use the "input()" word to ask the user which radius the circle is.
# You can do this by typing "radius = input()"
