# Create two integer variables and print their sum. What is the type of the
# result?

# Now, create a float variable and print its sum with an integer variable. What
# is the type of the result.

# Divide your smallest integer value by your largest integer value. Is the
# result what you expected? Now, do the same with your float variable and an
# integer variable. What to you get?

# Fill in the blanks, try adding the following two string variables and print
# the result. What do you get?
greeting = "My name is "
your_name = ""

# Try adding the following variables.
best_string = "I am "
your_age = 6


# Although Python can add integers and floats, it can't add strings and integers.
# In order to do this, we need to convert the integer variable to a string using
# the str keyword

# Uncomment the line below and check that it works.
# print(best_string + str(your_age))

# You can create complex string by using multiple string additions.
# Uncomment the line below and see the result.
# print(best_string + str(your_age) + " years old")

# We can also use the float keyword and the int keyword to convert variables to
# floats and ints respectively.

my_int = 5
print(float(my_int))

# Now, convert pi to an int.

pi = 3.1415
