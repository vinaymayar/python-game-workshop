#   We will define a new object, Animal
#   1) Think about what data attributes define an Animal in real life

#   2) Write the __init__ method for Animal
#   3) Write the getters and setters for Animal
#   4) Think about what actions and behaviors define an Animal
#       Examples include: talking, eating
#       Again, feel free to be creative!
#   5) Write at least two methods for Animal
#
#   Now, we will create a new instance of Animal
#   1) Run Animal.py
#   2) Create a new instance of Animal in the Python shell
#   3) Test the methods of Animal
